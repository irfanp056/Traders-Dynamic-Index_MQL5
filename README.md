# Traders Dynamic Index on MQL5
This indicator is based on the relative strength index, where a trade line is produced as the first product after the RSI is processed. The trade signal and market baseline are then made by taking the average of the trade line.

### About the indicator
#### Intro
A technical analysis tool used by traders and investors to assess market conditions and forecast price changes is the Traders Dynamic Index (TDI). It provides an all-encompassing market perspective by combining elements of volatility, momentum, and trend analysis. The TDI, created by Dean Malone, is a flexible indicator that may be used in various market circumstances and periods.

#### Components
The Price Line, the Trade Signal Line, and the Market Base Line are the three primary parts of the TDI. Each of these components plays a vital role in the overall performance and interpretation of the TDI.
